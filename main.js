 "Never write anything that does not give you great pleasure. Emotion is easily transferred from the writer to the reader.",
 "My own experience is that once a story has been written, one has to cross out the beginning and the end. It is there that we authors do most of our lying.",
 "The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do ",

var loveQutes=[ "If I know what love is, it is because of you." ,

"He is not a lover who does not love forever.",
"To love is to burn, to be on fire.",

"In the end we discover that to love and let go can be the same thing.",
"Pleasure of love lasts but a moment. Pain of love lasts a lifetime.",
"To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.",
"Love is an untamed force. When we try to control it, it destroys us. When we try to imprison it, it enslaves us. When we try to understand it, it leaves us feeling lost and confused.",
"Love is so short, forgetting is so long."
